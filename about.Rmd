### **Education**
##### Columbia University Mailman School of Publich Health *(2021 - Present)*

* Master of Science in Biostatistics

##### University of Wisconsin -- Madison *(2017 - 2020) *| Cumulative GPA: 3.98

* Bachelor of Science in Biology
* Bachelor of Science in Psychology

### **Research and Project Experience**

#### Peking Union Medical College Hospital MBC Lab – Beijing, China | July. 2021-Sep. 2021   
##### *Research Assistant*
* Aimed to find the plausible prognostic factors that might influence the survival time of metastatic breast cancer patients from censored patient cases
* Imported more than 600 censored patient cases data into SPSS, randomly assigned them to two groups and analyzed each factor respectively by using the Chi-square test to ensure the validity of the random assignment
* Used Log-rank test in K-M analysis to test the significance of single factors, then used Cox regres- sion to test the pre-significant single factor to run multi-factors analysis to exclude the false-positive results
* Used R studio to build nomogram model to predict the effect of certain factor and to visualize data

#### Application of Big Data in Traditional Chinese Medicine Project – Beijing, China | Jul. 2021-Sep. 2021   
##### *Research Assistant*
* Learned how knowledge graph was used in the field of TCM to form a visual graph to assist the di- agnose of TCM based on the data from previous cases
* Used Python to extract entities and relationships between the entities from more than 1000 TCM pa- tient cases, generating files that record nodes, relationships and triples respectively
* Imported nodes and relationships into Neo4j to build a visual graph of the data
* Searched information about relations between symptom, herb and prescription in Neo4j by using Cy-pher language

#### Anatomy Lab – UW Madison | Jan. 2020-May. 2020  
##### *Research Member*

* Aimed to find the effect of mental fatigue on physical performance
* Discussed the thesis and hypothesis, designed the research procedure, and ran the participants by
measuring maximum muscle strength and endurance to fatigue with a BSL Hand Dynamometer
using electromyography (EMG)
* Used a with-in group design to collect participants data in two levels, with an interval of a week be-
tween each measure, and analyzed the collected data in Excel using two-tailed t-test to compare the mean of maximum amplitude and mean time to fatigue between two levels

#### Cognitive Development & Communication Lab – UW Madison | Sep. 2019-Jan. 2021 

##### *Research Assistant*

* Participated in a project aiming to find whether physically interacting with manipulatives can help children learn the concept of equations more efficiently than just imagine interacting with manipula- tives by taking part in lab design, retrieved participants, ran participants and collected data
  
* Helped make filemaker to code participants’ data and coded data from another project with another RA to ensure the validity of coding
* Set up the online-version test suited for children during the pandemic
* Coded about 1,000 pictures related to the biological concept of phenotype and genotype in order to
collect information about ways of picture-drawing that can benefit children’s learning better


### **Work Experience**

#### Sigma Medical Statistic Company, Nanjing, China Aug. 2021 Part-time Data

##### *Analytic Assistant, Statistic Department*

* Used SAS and SPSS to randomly assign participants to different groups and centers, ensuring the double-blindness of certain experiments
* Put traditional paper form CRF in OpenClinica platform, checked the missing data values, and traced back to the clinical center where the data originated
* Imported the Excel raw data into SAS for grouping and sorting, visualized data using tables and ana- lyzed data by using T-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, or ANOVA test

### **Community Outreach Experience**  
#### University of Wisconsin-Madison Hospital, Madison, WI | Sept. 2019-May. 2020
##### *Volunteer*
* Interacted with patients in the psychiatric unit in UW Hospital for 2 hours per week during weekends
